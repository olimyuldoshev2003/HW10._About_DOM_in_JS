## Introduction to the DOM

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents an HTML document in memory and how to use APIs to create web content and applications.

## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

For example, the DOM specifies that the **querySelectorAll** method in this code snippet must return a list of all the **p** elements in the document:

<h2 style = "color:red;">Example:</h2>

```js
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
// paragraphs[0] is the first <p> element
// paragraphs[1] is the second <p> element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
```

All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into objects. For example, the **document** object that represents the document itself, any **table** objects that implement the **HTMLTableElement** DOM interface for accessing HTML tables, and so forth, are all objects.

The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. The core DOM defines the entities describing any document and the objects within it. This is expanded upon as needed by other APIs that add new features and capabilities to the DOM. For example, the HTML DOM API adds support for representing HTML documents to the core DOM, and the SVG API adds support for representing SVG documents.

## DOM and JavaScript

The previous short example, like nearly all examples, is JavaScript. That is to say, it is written in JavaScript, but uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.

The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts. For example, Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime.

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Even if most web developers will only use the DOM through JavaScript, implementations of the DOM can be built for any language, as this Python example demonstrates:

<h2 style = "color:red;">Example in the Puthon:</h2>

```py
# Python DOM example
import xml.dom.minidom as m
doc = m.parse(r"C:\Projects\Py\chap1.xml")
doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object
p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("para")
```

## Accessing the DOM

You don't have to do anything special to begin using the DOM. You use the API directly in JavaScript from within what is called a script, a program run by a browser.

When you create a script, whether inline in a **script** element or included in the web page, you can immediately begin using the API for the **document** or **window** objects to manipulate the document itself, or any of the various elements in the web page (the descendant elements of the document). Your DOM programming may be something as simple as the following example, which displays a message on the console by using the **console.log()** function:

<h2 style = "color:red;">Example:</h2>

```html
<body onload="console.log('Welcome to my home page!');">
  â€¦
</body>
```

As it is generally not recommended to mix the structure of the page (written in HTML) and manipulation of the DOM (written in JavaScript), the JavaScript parts will be grouped together here, and separated from the HTML.

For example, the following function creates a new **h1** element, adds text to that element, and then adds it to the tree for the document:

<h2 style = "color:red;">Example:</h2>

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script>
      // run this function when the document is loaded
      window.onload = () => {
        // create a couple of elements in an otherwise empty HTML page
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        const headingText = document.createTextNode("Big Head!");
        heading.appendChild(headingText);
        document.body.appendChild(heading);
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
